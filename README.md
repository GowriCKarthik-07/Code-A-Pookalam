### Pookalam Description
My aim was to build a realistic pookalam. This is basically a cute flower themed pookalam. I gave a flower with red petals in the middle and also stripes in the second layer which makes it attractive. I also included tiny flowers  with detailings  in the outermost circle which became my personal favourite part in this pookalam and i believe that it made the pookalam complete and special. 



### Technologies Used
